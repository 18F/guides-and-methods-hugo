      <description>By definition, this agile guide is a work in progress. We welcome community participation.
Prior to 2001, a majority of software development products failed to actually be useful to real people or were built over budget with missed deadlines. Early-stage technology coupled with an intuitive but ineffective development approach combined to make the actual delivery of successful, working software extremely difficult. During the 1980s in particular, the growing demands and expectations of the marketplace swamped the ability of the software development industry to build software as it was needed.</description>

      <description>What An evaluation method in which people work through a set of representative tasks and ask questions about the task as they go.
Why To get quick and early feedback on whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it is or isn’t easy. This method is useful for catching big issues at any stage in the design process when you don’t have access to real users, but it is not a substitute for user evaluation.</description>

Guidelines Do use the black version of the logo over a white background as your default. Bright blue (#00cfff) and white do not have enough contrast to meet accessibility requirements for low-vision users. Even though logos can be an exception to this rule, we prefer to follow best practices, and use black as our primary logo color. The bright blue version of the logo should only be used if you are using a dark page background.</description>
