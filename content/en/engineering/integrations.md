Our software is built on the shoulders of giants. We use several third parties
to perform continuous monitoring, host our apps, etc.

## Standards

While we don’t formally recommend third-party services, a handful have been
[approved](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/software/#get-access-to-software-we-already-have), procured, and provide services which
are essential for attaining an [Authority-to-Operate (ATO)](https://atos.open-control.org). To get started quickly
and to ease the ATO burden, use these systems; pain awaits your project
otherwise.

## Defaults

We also track a second set of services that aren’t as essential as the above,
but which we provide for consistency and shared knowledge across projects.
These are good defaults should their need arise; you should generally think
twice before building these tools yourself.
