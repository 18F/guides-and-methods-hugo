description: Offering usability test or user research participants gifts to encourage participation and to thank them for their time.
category: Fundamentals
what: Offering usability test or user research participants compensation to encourage participation and to thank them for their time.
why: Compensating participants for sharing their time and lived experience with your team often results in a more diverse, representative set of participants. Without compensation, you often end up recruiting people with a strong intrinsic interest in your website. These people may not have the same needs and experiences as a less interested pool of users. With compensation, you can encourage less interested, more representative people to participate.

## How to do it

1. Figure out what's legal and appropriate. Consult your agency's Office of General Counsel on options for providing compensation to encourage participation in usability testing, consistent with your agency's authorities. The options will depend upon your agency's authorities and the specific facts.
1. Consider contracting for a recruiting service to help you get an effective research pool.
1. If compensation is allowed, clearly communicate when and how participants will receive compensation. In the emails, postings, or other materials you use to recruit your participants, describe the compensation and how participants will receive it (via mail, pick up at an office, etc.). This is particularly important for "remote" research.

## Considerations for use in government  

No PRA implications. Even when users are present, the PRA explicitly exempts direct observation and non-standardized conversation, 5 CFR 1320.3(h)3.  
  
If you are not working with government employees, you will need to observe standard precautions for archiving personally identifiable information.
